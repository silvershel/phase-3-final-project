# STASH MANAGER
### Stash Manager is a program that keeps track of a user's knitting projects and yarn stash by allowing the user to input important details for each project and/or yarn.

## MENUS

### Main Menu
The main menu displays the three main components that make up a knitter's stash: projects, yarn, and needles. Currently this program is only built to handle projects and yarn, but the ability to add needles (and other tools) will be added in the future.

## FUTURE GOALS
Future features will include more filters (like yarn weight, yarn brand, or pattern designer) to sort through larger yarn and project libraries. The ability to track needles and other tools will also be added for a complete knitting Stash Manager.
